# Production Error Fixes - October 13, 2025

## Summary

Fixed multiple production errors affecting the deployed application. Some fixes have been deployed, others require Railway environment configuration updates.

## ‚úÖ FIXED - Coach Messages Database Constraint Error

### Error
```
coach_messages_ai_provider_check constraint violation
'stub' is not in ('anthropic', 'groq', 'openai', 'deepseek')
```

### Root Cause
The `coach_messages` table has a PostgreSQL CHECK constraint that only allows specific AI provider values. The stub/placeholder code was trying to insert `'stub'` which violated this constraint.

### Fix Applied
**File:** `app/api/v1/coach.py`
- Changed `ai_provider: "stub"` ‚Üí `ai_provider: None`
- Changed `ai_model: "placeholder"` ‚Üí `ai_model: None`
- Changed `model_used: "stub"` ‚Üí `model_used: None`

**Status:** ‚úÖ Committed and pushed to GitHub (commit `8c0b617`)

**Result:** Coach chat will now work without database errors. Messages will show NULL for AI provider/model in stub mode.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRES ACTION - CORS Configuration

### Error
```
Access to fetch at 'https://ultimatecoachbackend-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/dashboard/summary'
from origin 'https://www.sharpened.me' has been blocked by CORS policy:
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

### Root Cause
The backend's `CORS_ORIGINS` environment variable on Railway only includes `http://localhost:3000` (development URL). The production frontend at `https://www.sharpened.me` is being blocked.

### Fix Required
Update Railway environment variable:

**Current value:**
```
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000
```

**New value (comma-separated list):**
```
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,https://www.sharpened.me,https://sharpened.me
```

**Alternatively (less secure but allows all):**
```
ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS=true
```

### Steps to Apply
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Navigate to ULTIMATE_COACH_BACKEND project
3. Go to **Variables** tab
4. Update `CORS_ORIGINS` to include production domains
5. Click **Save** (this will trigger a new deployment)

**Status:** ‚è≥ Waiting for manual update on Railway

## üîç UNDER INVESTIGATION - Activities API 500 Errors

### Error
```
GET /api/v1/activities?limit=50 - 500 Internal Server Error
GET /api/v1/activities/summary - 500 Internal Server Error
```

### Observations
- Error is happening on the backend (not CORS)
- Activities API code looks correct
- Likely causes:
  1. Database schema mismatch (activities table structure)
  2. Missing required fields in database
  3. RLS (Row Level Security) policy issues
  4. Service layer error

### Next Steps
Need to check:
1. Recent database migrations applied correctly
2. Activities table schema matches code expectations
3. Backend deployment logs for detailed error traces
4. Test with direct API call (using Postman/curl) to isolate issue

**Status:** ‚è≥ Needs investigation (cannot fix without seeing backend error logs)

---

## üîç UNDER INVESTIGATION - Dashboard API 500 Error

### Error
```
GET /api/v1/dashboard/summary - Failed to load resource (after CORS fix)
```

### Observations
- This error will be clearer once CORS is fixed
- Currently hidden behind CORS error
- May be related to activities API errors

### Next Steps
1. Fix CORS first
2. Re-test to see actual error
3. Check if it's related to activities aggregation

**Status:** ‚è≥ Blocked by CORS fix, will investigate after

---

## Files Changed

### Backend
- ‚úÖ `app/api/v1/coach.py` - Fixed ai_provider constraint violation

### Frontend
- ‚úÖ `app/activities/log/page.tsx` - Fixed Suspense boundary (previous fix)

---

## Deployment Status

### Backend (Railway)
- ‚úÖ Code fixes pushed to GitHub (commit `8c0b617`)
- ‚è≥ **Action Required:** Update CORS_ORIGINS environment variable on Railway
- ‚è≥ After env var update, Railway will auto-deploy

### Frontend (Vercel)
- ‚úÖ All fixes deployed (commit `da3826e`)
- ‚úÖ Build successful
- ‚úÖ Live at https://www.sharpened.me

---

## Testing After CORS Fix

Once CORS is updated on Railway, test these flows:

1. **Coach Chat**
   - ‚úÖ Should work without constraint errors
   - ‚úÖ Messages should save correctly
   - ‚úÖ Stub responses should appear

2. **Activities**
   - ‚è≥ Still needs investigation
   - Test: Visit `/activities` page
   - Expected: May still show errors (separate issue)

3. **Dashboard**
   - ‚è≥ Blocked by CORS, test after fix
   - Test: Visit `/dashboard` page
   - Expected: Should load summary (or reveal actual error)

---

## Recommended Actions (Priority Order)

### 1. HIGH PRIORITY - Update Railway CORS (5 minutes)
   - Go to Railway dashboard
   - Update `CORS_ORIGINS` environment variable
   - Add: `https://www.sharpened.me,https://sharpened.me`
   - Save and wait for deployment (~2-3 minutes)

### 2. MEDIUM PRIORITY - Test after CORS fix (10 minutes)
   - Visit https://www.sharpened.me
   - Test coach chat (should work now)
   - Test activities page (may still error - separate issue)
   - Test dashboard (will reveal actual error if any)
   - Check browser console for new errors

### 3. MEDIUM PRIORITY - Check Railway logs (15 minutes)
   - Go to Railway deployment logs
   - Look for activities API error traces
   - Copy full error stack traces
   - Share with me to diagnose activities/dashboard errors

### 4. LOW PRIORITY - Database verification (if needed)
   - Verify all migrations applied
   - Check activities table schema
   - Verify RLS policies active
   - (Only if activities error persists after CORS fix)
