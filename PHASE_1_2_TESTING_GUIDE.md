# üöÄ PHASE 1 & 2 TESTING GUIDE

Complete testing guide for Program Display System (Phase 1) and Calendar/Progress Tracking (Phase 2).

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è PREREQUISITES

### 1. Run Migration 045 (REQUIRED)

Before testing, you **MUST** run the database migration that adds `completed_at` columns.

**Via Supabase Dashboard (Recommended):**

1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Click on project: `txuebspgxwtnwmwiwxfo`
3. Navigate to **SQL Editor** ‚Üí **New Query**
4. Copy/paste from `migrations/045_add_completed_at_columns.sql`
5. Click **Run**
6. Verify: "Success. No rows returned"

**Verification Query:**
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name IN ('session_instances', 'meal_instances')
  AND column_name = 'completed_at';
```

Should return 2 rows (one for each table).

**What happens if you skip this:**
- "Mark Complete" buttons will return 500 errors
- Error: "column completed_at does not exist"

## üîç DEBUGGING

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Migration not run
- **Symptom:** 500 error when marking items complete
- **Error:** "column completed_at does not exist"
- **Fix:** Run migration 045 via Supabase Dashboard

**Issue:** Calendar events not appearing
- **Symptom:** Empty calendar page
- **Check:** Did program generation complete successfully?
- **Verify:** Query database:
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM calendar_events WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id';
  ```
- **Expected:** Should have events (sessions + meals √ó 7 days √ó weeks)

**Issue:** Calendar status not updating
- **Symptom:** Complete items, but calendar still shows "planned"
- **Check:** Backend logs for "calendar_event_updated" log entry
- **Verify:** Query database:
  ```sql
  SELECT status FROM calendar_events WHERE ref_id = 'session-or-meal-id';
  ```
- **Expected:** Status should be "completed"

**Issue:** Progress page shows zero counts
- **Symptom:** All days show 0 completed
- **Check:** Have you marked any items complete?
- **Verify:** Calendar events exist with completed status:
  ```sql
  SELECT date, status, COUNT(*)
  FROM calendar_events
  WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id'
  GROUP BY date, status;
  ```

### Backend Logs

**Check Railway Logs:**
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Select `ULTIMATE_COACH_BACKEND` project
3. View logs tab

{"event": "program_generated", "program_id": "...", "sessions": 48, "meals": 252}
{"event": "calendar_events_created", "program_id": "...", "events": 300}
```

**Successful Completion Log:**
