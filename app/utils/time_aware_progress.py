Time-Aware Progress Calculation

Calculates whether user is on track with their nutrition/fitness goals
based on TIME OF DAY, not just absolute numbers.

Example: 500 cal at 6 AM = AHEAD of schedule (great start!)
         500 cal at 2 PM = BEHIND schedule (need to eat more!)

This prevents coach from nagging users who started their day well.
