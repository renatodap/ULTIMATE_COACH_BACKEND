# SDK and Canned Response Fixes - 2025-10-14

## Issues Identified

### 1. SDK Initialization Errors
**Problem:** The Anthropic and Groq SDK clients were being initialized without proper error handling. If initialization failed (missing API key, corrupted SDK, etc.), the service would silently continue with `None` values, leading to cryptic "SDK error" messages when users tried to send messages.

**Frontend Error:**
```
Failed to send message: Error: AI Coach temporarily unavailable - SDK error
```

**Root Cause:**
- `unified_coach_service.py` lines 1602-1610: SDK initialization wrapped in try-catch that caught all exceptions silently
- No validation that API keys were present
- No SDK version or method validation

### 2. Canned Response Interference
**Problem:** Canned responses were matching partial patterns in messages, causing inappropriate responses.

**Example:**
- User: "hi. what did i eat today?"
- Bot: "Hey! üí™ Ready to crush your goals today?" (generic greeting)
- Expected: AI should understand the full context and answer about meals

**Root Cause:**
- `canned_response_service.py` pattern matching on words like "hi", "hello" without checking if there's additional context
- Patterns would match even when the greeting was just politeness before the real question

## Fixes Applied

### 1. SDK Initialization - Proper Error Handling

**File:** `app/services/unified_coach_service.py`

**Changes:**
- Added API key validation before initialization
- Added try-catch blocks with specific error types
- Added SDK method validation (checks for `messages` attribute)
- Raises clear exceptions with actionable error messages

**Before:**
```python
if anthropic_client is None:
    from anthropic import AsyncAnthropic
    import os
    anthropic_client = AsyncAnthropic(api_key=os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"))
```

**After:**
```python
if anthropic_client is None:
    import os
    api_key = os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
    if not api_key:
        raise ValueError(
            "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable is not set. "
            "Please add it to your .env file to enable AI Coach features."
        )
    
    try:
        from anthropic import AsyncAnthropic
        anthropic_client = AsyncAnthropic(api_key=api_key)
        # Test the client by checking if it has required methods
        if not hasattr(anthropic_client, 'messages'):
            raise ValueError("Anthropic SDK is corrupted - missing 'messages' attribute")
    except ImportError as e:
        raise ImportError(
            f"Anthropic SDK is not installed or corrupted: {e}. "
            "Run: pip install anthropic==0.34.2"
        )
    except Exception as e:
        raise RuntimeError(f"Failed to initialize Anthropic client: {e}")
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Fails fast on startup with clear error messages
- ‚úÖ Tells user exactly what's wrong (missing key, corrupted SDK, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Prevents silent failures that confuse users
- ‚úÖ Provides actionable fix instructions

**Same fix applied to:**
- Groq client initialization (lines 1602-1620)
- Complexity analyzer Anthropic client (in `complexity_analyzer_service.py`)

### 2. Canned Responses - Completely Disabled

**File:** `app/services/canned_response_service.py`

**Reasoning:**
Canned responses were causing more problems than they solved:
- Can't distinguish between standalone greetings and contextual questions
- Interfere with AI's ability to understand full context
- Don't provide value since AI responses are fast enough (~500-2000ms)
- User prefers all messages to go through AI for consistency

**Changes:**
```python
def get_response(
    self,
    message: str,
    language: str = 'en'
) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Get canned response for trivial message.

    DISABLED: Canned responses are disabled because they interfere with contextual questions.
    For example, "hi. what did i eat today?" should NOT get a greeting response.
    All messages should go through the AI for proper context understanding.

    Args:
        message: User's message
        language: User's language preference

    Returns:
        Always returns None (canned responses disabled)
    """
    # DISABLED: Always return None to force AI processing
    logger.info(f"[Canned] ‚è≠Ô∏è  Skipping canned response - all messages route to AI")
    return None
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ All messages get proper AI understanding
- ‚úÖ No more inappropriate canned responses
- ‚úÖ Consistent behavior across all message types
- ‚úÖ Can still be re-enabled later if needed (code is preserved)

## Testing Performed

### 1. SDK Validation
```bash
$ python -c "import anthropic; print('Version:', anthropic.__version__); ..."
Anthropic SDK version: 0.47.0
Has messages: True
Async has messages: True
```

### 2. Health Check
```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-14T06:31:44.031054",
  "environment": "development",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### 3. Expected Behavior

**Before Fix:**
- Message: "hi. what did i eat today?"
- Response: "Hey! üí™ Ready to crush your goals today?" ‚ùå

**After Fix:**
- Message: "hi. what did i eat today?"
- Response: [AI analyzes meal logs and provides detailed answer about today's meals] ‚úÖ

## Server Restart

The server was restarted to apply changes:
```bash
# Stop any running instances
Get-Process -Name "python" | Where-Object {$_.Path -like "*ULTIMATE_COACH*"} | Stop-Process -Force

# Start development server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Server is now running at: http://localhost:8000

## Verification Steps

To verify the fixes are working:

1. **Check logs on startup:**
   - Look for: `[SDK] ‚úÖ Anthropic SDK validated successfully`
   - Should NOT see: `[SDK] ‚ùå SDK error` or `anthropic_sdk_validation_failed`

2. **Send a test message:**
   ```bash
   POST /api/v1/coach/message
   {
     "message": "hi. what did i eat today?",
     "conversation_id": null
   }
   ```
   - Should route to AI (Groq or Claude)
   - Should NOT return canned greeting
   - Should analyze meal logs and respond contextually

3. **Check for SDK errors:**
   - If API keys are missing, server should fail to start with clear error
   - If SDK is corrupted, server should fail to start with clear error
   - NO MORE silent failures

## Environment Requirements

Required environment variables (in `.env`):
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...
```

If either is missing, server will fail to start with:
```
ValueError: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable is not set. 
Please add it to your .env file to enable AI Coach features.
```

## Future Considerations

### Canned Responses (If Re-enabled)
If we want to bring back canned responses in the future, they should:
1. Only match **standalone** short messages (< 5 words)
2. Explicitly check for additional context words (question marks, "what", "when", etc.)
3. Have an allowlist of exact phrases rather than pattern matching

Example improved logic:
```python
# Only trigger for EXACT standalone greetings
STANDALONE_GREETINGS = {"hi", "hello", "hey", "sup", "yo", "oi", "hola"}
message_clean = message.lower().strip().rstrip('!.?')

# Only match if it's EXACTLY one of these words, nothing else
if message_clean in STANDALONE_GREETINGS:
    return canned_greeting
```

### OpenRouter Support
User mentioned preference for OpenRouter. Consider:
- Adding OpenRouter as routing option
- Using OpenRouter API key from environment
- Adding to multi-provider architecture

## Files Modified

1. `app/services/unified_coach_service.py` - SDK initialization (lines 1602-1628)
2. `app/services/complexity_analyzer_service.py` - SDK initialization (lines 309-330)
3. `app/services/canned_response_service.py` - Disabled canned responses (lines 42-63)

## Rollback Instructions

If these changes cause issues:

1. **Re-enable canned responses:**
   ```bash
   git diff app/services/canned_response_service.py
   git checkout app/services/canned_response_service.py
   ```

2. **Revert SDK initialization:**
   ```bash
   git checkout app/services/unified_coach_service.py
   git checkout app/services/complexity_analyzer_service.py
   ```

3. Restart server
