# Gram-Based Meal Logging Fix

**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Issue:** Backend rejecting gram-based meal logging
**Status:** ✅ FIXED (deployed to Railway)

---

## Problem

Backend was throwing error when frontend sent `serving_id = null` for gram-based logging:

```
error: Serving None not found for food 47532767-c34c-45bb-b82b-235505086bca
event: meal_creation_error
user_id: 38a5596a-9397-4660-8180-132c50541964
```

**User Experience:**
- User searches for "banana" → ✅ Works (fixed by RPC function)
- User adds "100g of banana" to meal → ✅ Frontend works
- User clicks "Log Meal" → ❌ Backend rejects with "Serving None not found"

---

## Root Cause

The backend `create_meal()` function in `nutrition_service.py` always required a `serving_id`, even though:

1. **Model layer** said it was optional: `serving_id: Optional[UUID]`
2. **Frontend** sends `serving_id: null` for gram-based logging
3. **Database** allows `serving_id` to be NULL

**Problem code** (lines 633-638 - BEFORE FIX):
```python
# Find serving
serving = next(
    (s for s in food.servings if s.id == item.serving_id), None
)
if not serving:
    raise InvalidServingError(str(item.serving_id), str(item.food_id))
```

When `item.serving_id` is None:
1. Generator `s.id == None` never matches any serving
2. `serving` becomes None
3. Code raises `InvalidServingError("None", food_id)`

---

## The Fix

Modified `create_meal()` in `app/services/nutrition_service.py` to support two logging methods:

### 1. Gram-Based Logging (NEW)

```python
if item.serving_id is None:
    # GRAM-BASED LOGGING: Use item.grams directly
    grams = item.grams
    serving = None  # No serving needed

    # Use nutrition values from frontend (already calculated)
    item_calories = item.calories
    item_protein = item.protein_g
    item_carbs = item.carbs_g
    item_fat = item.fat_g
```

**How it works:**
- Frontend calculates nutrition from food's `per_100g` values
- Frontend sends pre-calculated values: `grams`, `calories`, `protein_g`, etc.
- Backend trusts frontend calculations (same formula both sides)
- No serving validation needed

### 2. Serving-Based Logging (EXISTING)

```python
else:
    # SERVING-BASED LOGGING: Find and validate serving
    serving = next(
        (s for s in food.servings if s.id == item.serving_id), None
    )
    if not serving:
        raise InvalidServingError(str(item.serving_id), str(item.food_id))

    # Calculate nutrition from serving
    grams = item.quantity * serving.grams_per_serving
    # ... calculate nutrition ...
```

**How it works:**
- Frontend sends `serving_id` + `quantity`
- Backend validates serving exists and belongs to food
- Backend calculates nutrition from `per_100g` values
- More validation = more data integrity

### 3. Database Insert

```python
meal_items_data.append({
    "meal_id": meal_id,
    "food_id": str(validated["food"].id),
    "quantity": float(validated["quantity"]),
    "serving_id": str(serving.id) if serving else None,  # ← Can be None
    "grams": float(validated["grams"]),
    "calories": float(validated["calories"]),
    "protein_g": float(validated["protein_g"]),
    "carbs_g": float(validated["carbs_g"]),
    "fat_g": float(validated["fat_g"]),
    "display_unit": serving.serving_unit if serving else "g",  # ← "g" for gram-based
    "display_label": serving.serving_label if serving else None,
    "display_order": validated["display_order"],
})
```

## Files Modified

### Backend
- **`app/services/nutrition_service.py`** (lines 561-735)
  - Added conditional logic for `serving_id = None`
  - Updated docstring to document both methods
  - Updated meal_items insert to handle None serving

## Testing Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [x] Code modified and tested locally
- [x] Committed to git with clear message
- [x] Pushed to GitHub main branch
- [x] Railway auto-deployment triggered

### Post-Deployment (User to verify)

1. **Search for food:**
   - Navigate to nutrition log page
   - Search for "banana"
   - **Expected:** Results appear ✅

2. **Log gram-based meal:**
   - Add "100g of banana" to meal
   - Click "Log Meal"
   - **Expected:** Meal saved successfully ✅
   - **Expected:** No "Serving None not found" error ✅

3. **Log serving-based meal:**
   - Search for "protein powder"
   - Add "2 scoops" to meal
   - Click "Log Meal"
   - **Expected:** Meal saved successfully ✅

4. **Check Railway logs:**
   - **Expected:** `meal_created` event (not `meal_creation_error`)
   - **Expected:** No "Serving None not found" errors

## Timeline of Fixes

This is the **3rd fix** in the meal logging flow:

1. **Oct 16, 2025 (Morning):** PostgREST crash on food search
   - **Problem:** Cloudflare Error 1101 when querying foods table
   - **Fix:** Created RPC function `search_foods_safe()` to bypass PostgREST
   - **Status:** ✅ Fixed (migrations 040, 041 applied)

2. **Oct 16, 2025 (Afternoon):** Content-Type header missing
   - **Problem:** Backend received JSON as text/plain string
   - **Fix:** Added explicit `'Content-Type': 'application/json'` header
   - **Status:** ✅ Fixed (frontend `lib/api/nutrition.ts`)

3. **Oct 16, 2025 (Late Afternoon):** Backend requires serving_id (THIS FIX)
   - **Problem:** Backend rejected gram-based logging
   - **Fix:** Modified `create_meal()` to support `serving_id = null`
   - **Status:** ✅ Fixed (deployed to Railway)

---

## Success Criteria

✅ **Meal logging is fully working when:**

1. User can search for foods and get results
2. User can log gram-based meals (100g of banana)
3. User can log serving-based meals (2 scoops of protein)
4. No "Serving None not found" errors in Railway logs
5. Meals appear in nutrition page after logging
6. Both `meal_created` and `meal_creation_error` events tracked correctly

## Technical Notes

### Why Trust Frontend Calculations?

**Question:** Why does backend trust frontend's nutrition values for gram-based logging?

**Answer:**
1. Frontend uses same formula: `(grams / 100) * per_100g_value`
2. Both use same data source: `food.calories_per_100g`, etc.
3. Backend already stores frontend-calculated values in `meal_items` table
4. "Calculate once, store forever" pattern
5. Reduces backend calculation overhead

**Security:** User can only modify their own meals. Nutrition values are for display only, not financial transactions.

### Serving-Based vs Gram-Based

| Feature | Gram-Based | Serving-Based |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Frontend sends | `grams`, nutrition values | `serving_id`, `quantity` |
| Backend validates | Food exists | Food + serving exist |
| Backend calculates | None (trusts frontend) | Nutrition from serving |
| Database stores | `serving_id = null` | `serving_id = UUID` |
| Display unit | "g" | Serving unit ("scoop", "cup") |
| Use case | Raw ingredients | Packaged foods |

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If this fix causes issues:

### Option 1: Revert to Previous Version

```bash
cd ULTIMATE_COACH_BACKEND
git revert 10efa4c
git push origin main
```

Railway will auto-deploy the reverted version.

### Option 2: Disable Gram-Based Logging

Frontend change - reject null serving_id:

```typescript
// lib/api/nutrition.ts
export async function createMeal(request: CreateMealRequest) {
  // Validate all items have serving_id
  for (const item of request.items) {
    if (!item.serving_id) {
      throw new Error("Serving required for all meal items")
    }
  }
  // ... rest of function
}
```

This forces users to always select a serving (even if it's a "100g serving").

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate
- Monitor Railway logs for `meal_created` events
- Verify no `meal_creation_error` events
- Test gram-based and serving-based logging in production

### Future Enhancements
- Add validation to ensure frontend nutrition matches backend calculation
- Add logging to track gram-based vs serving-based usage
- Consider adding "default 100g serving" to all foods to simplify UX
