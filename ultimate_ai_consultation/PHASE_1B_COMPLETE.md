## Integration with Phase 1A

Phase 1B **depends on** and **extends** Phase 1A:

| Phase 1A Component | Used By Phase 1B |
|--------------------|------------------|
| TDEECalculator | PlanGenerator (energy baseline) |
| MacroCalculator | PlanGenerator (macro targets) |
| SafetyValidator | PlanGenerator (safety gate) |
| ConstraintSolver | PlanGenerator (feasibility check) |
| Database migration | Plan storage schema |

**Seamless Integration:**
```python
# Phase 1A imports work directly in Phase 1B
from libs.calculators.tdee import TDEECalculator
from libs.calculators.macros import MacroCalculator
from services.validators.safety_gate import SafetyValidator
from services.solver.constraint_solver import ConstraintSolver

# Phase 1B adds program generation on top
from services.program_generator import PlanGenerator

# All components work together
plan_generator = PlanGenerator()  # Internally uses all Phase 1A components
plan, warnings = plan_generator.generate_complete_plan(profile)
```

---

## Database Storage

**Plans are stored in the `plan_versions` table** (created in Phase 1A migration):

```sql
-- Phase 1A created this table
CREATE TABLE plan_versions (
    plan_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    version INTEGER NOT NULL,
    data JSONB NOT NULL,  -- Complete plan JSON from plan_generator.export_plan_to_json()
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true
);
```

**JSON Schema:**
```json
{
  "plan_id": "plan_user_123_20251013_143022",
  "user_id": "user_123",
  "version": 1,
  "goal": "muscle_gain",
  "tdee_result": { "tdee_mean": 3150, "ci_lower": 2980, ... },

        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "meal_plans": [

| Produce | $30-40 | 15-20% |
| Grains | $20-25 | 10-12% |
| Dairy & Eggs | $25-30 | 12-15% |
| Pantry | $15-20 | 8-10% |
| **TOTAL** | **$165-205** | **100%** |

**Per-Day Cost:** $11.79 - $14.64

**Bulk Buying Savings:** 15-20% on chicken, rice, oats, almonds

**Cost Optimization Tips:**
1. Buy seasonal produce (20-30% cheaper at farmers markets)
2. Purchase family packs of chicken breast
3. Buy dry grains in bulk
4. Frozen vegetables have same nutrition, lower cost

---

## What's Next: Phase 2 - Adaptive Loop

Phase 1B delivers the **initial program**. Phase 2 implements the **adaptive adjustment system**:

**Phase 2 Components (Planned):**
- **Data Aggregator**: Pull from meals/activities/body_metrics tables
- **PID Controllers**: Adjust calories and training volume based on progress
- **Sentiment Analyzer**: Extract adherence signals from coach messages
- **Plan Versioning**: Track adjustments over time
- **Bi-weekly Reassessment**: Automated check-ins every 14 days

**Adaptive Adjustments:**
```python
# User falls behind fat loss target
if actual_rate < target_rate * 0.8:
    # PID controller increases calorie deficit
    new_calories = current_calories - adjustment

# User exceeds volume tolerance (fatigue accumulating)
if volume_adherence < 0.7:
    # Reduce volume 10-15%
    trigger_mini_deload()
```
