# ðŸ§  PERSONA SYSTEM
## Context-Aware User Classification

**Last Updated:** October 14, 2025
**Version:** 1.0

---

## Overview

The Persona System is the intelligence layer that makes ULTIMATE COACH truly adaptive. Instead of one-size-fits-all programming, we detect which of 10 personas the user matches and customize:

- **Training frequency** (3-6 sessions/week)
- **Session duration** (20-75 minutes)
- **Exercise selection** (home-friendly, gym-only, travel-friendly)
- **System prompt tone** (encouraging, scientific, safety-focused)
- **Reassessment sensitivity** (strict vs flexible)

## How Persona Detection Works

### Detection Algorithm

The `detect_persona()` function in `backend/app/services/persona_detection.py` uses a **weighted scoring system**:

1. **Keyword Matching** (40% weight)
   - Scans consultation data for persona-specific keywords
   - Examples:
     - "kids", "children" â†’ Busy Parent
     - "college athlete", "D1" â†’ College Athlete
     - "doctor recommended" â†’ Medical Referral

2. **Age Range Matching** (20% weight)
   - Each persona has preferred age range
   - Boosts score if user's age falls within range

3. **Goal Alignment** (20% weight)
   - Matches stated goals to persona goals
   - Examples:
     - "build muscle" â†’ Homebody Lifter, Young Biohacker
     - "stay healthy" â†’ Busy Parent, Medical Referral

4. **Equipment Access** (10% weight)
   - Matches available equipment to persona needs
   - "home gym" â†’ Homebody Lifter, Busy Parent
   - "no gym" â†’ Long-Haul Trucker

5. **Schedule Constraints** (10% weight)
   - Matches time availability
   - "limited time" â†’ 9-to-5 Hustler
   - "unpredictable" â†’ Busy Parent

### Confidence Scoring

Returns persona with highest score and confidence level:

```python
{
  "persona_type": "Busy Parent",
  "confidence": 0.87,
  "reasoning": "Matched keywords: kids, home gym, unpredictable. Age 35 in range. Limited time availability."
}
```

**Confidence Thresholds:**
- **0.8-1.0**: Strong match, apply all adaptations
- **0.6-0.79**: Moderate match, apply most adaptations
- **< 0.6**: Weak match, use general program

---

## How Adaptations Are Applied

### 1. Program Generation

When `generate_program()` is called:

```python
# Detect persona
persona_result = await detect_persona(consultation_data)

# Get adaptations
adaptations = PERSONAS[persona_result['persona_type']].adaptations

# Generate activity templates based on adaptations
templates = generate_templates(
    sessions_per_week=adaptations['sessions_per_week'],
    duration=adaptations['session_duration_minutes'],
    equipment=adaptations['equipment'],
    intensity=adaptations['intensity_target']
)

# Store persona in user_profiles_extended
await store_persona(user_id, persona_result)
```

### 2. System Prompt Customization

The unified coach gets persona-specific context:

```python
system_prompt = BASE_SYSTEM_PROMPT + persona.system_prompt_additions

# Example for Busy Parent:
"""
You are a compassionate fitness coach.

This user is a busy parent with unpredictable schedule.
- Create SHORT 20-30min workouts
- Use encouraging, non-guilt language
- Celebrate small wins
"""
```

### 3. Reassessment Logic

Bi-weekly reassessments use persona traits:

```python
if persona.skip_friendly and adherence < 50%:
    # Don't penalize, understand life is chaotic
    adjustment = "maintain"
elif persona.flexibility_required:
    # Context-adjusted adherence
    adjusted_adherence = calculate_context_adjusted_adherence(user_id)
```

---

## Adding New Personas

To add a new persona:

### 1. Define Persona in `persona_detection.py`

```python
PERSONAS["New Persona Name"] = PersonaDefinition(
    keywords=["keyword1", "keyword2"],
    age_range=(min_age, max_age),
    goals=["goal1", "goal2"],
    adaptations={
        "sessions_per_week": 4,
        "session_duration_minutes": 45,
        "exercises_per_session": 5,
        "intensity_target": "RPE 6-8",
        "equipment": ["equipment_type"],
        "system_prompt_additions": """
        Custom prompt additions here
        """
    }
)
```

### 2. Update Detection Logic

Add persona to scoring function if needed (usually automatic).

### 3. Update Documentation

Add persona to this file with full profile and example.

### 4. Test Detection

```python
from app.services.persona_detection import detect_persona

consultation_data = {
    "age": 35,
    "fitness_goals": "test goal",
    "notes": "test notes with keywords"
}

result = await detect_persona(consultation_data)
print(result)
```

---

## Persona Override

Users can manually override detected persona:

```python
# Backend endpoint
@router.post("/programs/{user_id}/override-persona")
async def override_persona(
    user_id: UUID,
    persona_type: str,
    confidence: float = 1.0
):
    """
    Manually set user's persona (admin/support use)
    """
    await db.execute("""
        UPDATE user_profiles_extended
        SET persona_type = $1,
            persona_confidence = $2,
            persona_override = TRUE
        WHERE user_id = $3
    """, persona_type, confidence, user_id)
```

---

## Persona Analytics

Track persona distribution:

```sql
SELECT
    persona_type,
    COUNT(*) as user_count,
    AVG(persona_confidence) as avg_confidence,
    AVG(adherence_30d) as avg_adherence
FROM user_profiles_extended
WHERE persona_type IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY persona_type
ORDER BY user_count DESC;
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Detection Quality
- Require rich consultation data for accurate detection
- Use confidence thresholds (< 0.6 = use general program)
- Allow manual override for edge cases

### 2. Adaptation Sensitivity
- Start conservative, adjust based on feedback
- Monitor adherence by persona
- Fine-tune adaptations based on real user data

### 3. System Prompt Quality
- Be specific in prompt additions
- Test different personas with same requests
- Ensure tone matches persona expectations

### 4. Avoid Stereotyping
- Personas are starting points, not constraints
- Allow user deviation from persona norms
- Adjust based on actual behavior, not just persona

---

## Testing Personas

### Test Detection

```bash
# Test all personas with sample data
python -m pytest tests/test_persona_detection.py

# Test specific persona
python scripts/test_persona.py --persona "Busy Parent"
```

### Test Adaptations

```bash
# Generate program for each persona
python scripts/generate_test_programs.py --all-personas

# Compare adherence by persona
python scripts/analyze_persona_adherence.py --days 30
```

---

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Dynamic Persona Evolution
Track user behavior over time and adjust persona classification:
- Busy Parent â†’ 9-to-5 Hustler (kids grew up, more time available)
- Social Starter â†’ College Athlete (got serious, increased capacity)

### 2. Hybrid Personas
Allow users to match multiple personas:
- "Busy Parent" + "Medical Referral" (60%, 40% weight)

### 3. Machine Learning Classification
Train ML model on user data to improve detection accuracy beyond rule-based system.

### 4. Persona-Specific Onboarding
Customize consultation questions based on suspected persona.
