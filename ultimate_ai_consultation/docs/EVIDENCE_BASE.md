This document outlines the research-backed protocols used in the adaptive system.

## Nutrition Calculations

### TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)

**Formulas Implemented:**

1. **Mifflin-St Jeor (1990)** - Primary equation
   - Most validated for general population
   - `RMR = (10 × weight_kg) + (6.25 × height_cm) - (5 × age) + s`
   - `s = +5 for males, -161 for females`
   - Reference: Mifflin et al. (1990). "A new predictive equation for resting energy expenditure in healthy individuals." *Am J Clin Nutr* 51:241-7.

2. **Harris-Benedict Revised (1984)**
   - Widely used baseline
   - Men: `RMR = 88.362 + (13.397 × weight) + (4.799 × height) - (5.677 × age)`
   - Women: `RMR = 447.593 + (9.247 × weight) + (3.098 × height) - (4.330 × age)`
   - Reference: Roza & Shizgal (1984). "The Harris Benedict equation reevaluated." *Am J Clin Nutr* 40:168-82.

3. **Katch-McArdle** - When body composition known
   - Most accurate with lean mass data
   - `RMR = 370 + (21.6 × lean_mass_kg)`
   - Reference: Katch & McArdle (1996). *Exercise Physiology*.

4. **Cunningham (1991)** - Alternative body composition equation
   - `RMR = 500 + (22 × lean_mass_kg)`
   - Reference: Cunningham (1991). "Body composition as a determinant of energy expenditure." *Am J Clin Nutr* 54:963-9.

**Activity Factors (PAL):**
- Sedentary: 1.2
- Lightly active: 1.375
- Moderately active: 1.55
- Very active: 1.725
- Extra active: 1.9

### Protein Requirements

**Evidence-Based Targets:**

| Goal | Target (g/kg/day) | Reference |
|------|-------------------|-----------|
| Fat Loss | 2.0-2.4 | Helms et al. (2014) |
| Muscle Gain | 1.6-2.2 | Morton et al. (2018) |
| Maintenance | 1.6-2.0 | Phillips & Van Loon (2011) |

## Training Protocols

### Volume Landmarks (Renaissance Periodization)

**Definitions:**

- **MRV** (Maximum Recoverable Volume): Most sets per week you can do and still recover
- **MAV** (Maximum Adaptive Volume): Volume that drives most growth
- **MEV** (Minimum Effective Volume): Minimum to maintain or make progress

**Per Muscle Group Per Week:**

| Muscle Group | MEV | MAV | MRV |
|--------------|-----|-----|-----|
| Chest | 10 | 14-18 | 22 |
| Back | 12 | 16-20 | 25 |
| Shoulders | 8 | 12-16 | 20 |
| Quads | 8 | 12-16 | 20 |
| Hamstrings | 6 | 10-14 | 18 |
| Arms | 6 | 10-14 | 18 |
| Calves | 6 | 10-14 | 18 |

**Reference:** Israetel, M., Hoffman, J., & Smith, C. (2017). *Scientific Principles of Strength Training.* Juggernaut Training Systems.

### Progressive Overload

**Volume Progression:**
- Increase total volume by 5-10% per week
- **Never exceed 20% weekly increase** (injury risk)
- Deload every 4-6 weeks (reduce volume 40-60%, maintain intensity)

**Reference:** Schoenfeld et al. (2019). "Resistance Training Volume Enhances Muscle Hypertrophy." *Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise* 51(1):94-103.

### Training Splits

**Full Body (2-3x/week):**
- Best for beginners (<1 year training)
- Each session hits all major muscle groups
- 48-72 hours rest between sessions

**Upper/Lower (4x/week):**
- Intermediate (1-3 years training)
- Upper: Chest, back, shoulders, arms
- Lower: Quads, hamstrings, glutes, calves
- 2x frequency per muscle group

**Push/Pull/Legs (6x/week):**
- Advanced (3+ years training)
- Push: Chest, shoulders, triceps
- Pull: Back, biceps
- Legs: Quads, hamstrings, glutes, calves
- 2x frequency per muscle group

### Intensity Zones

**Strength Focus:**
- 1-5 reps @ 85-95% 1RM
- 3-5 min rest
- 2-3 RIR (reps in reserve)

**Hypertrophy Focus:**
- 6-12 reps @ 67-85% 1RM
- 2-3 min rest
- 1-3 RIR

**Muscular Endurance:**
- 12-20+ reps @ <67% 1RM
- 1-2 min rest
- 0-2 RIR

## Endurance Training

### Polarized Training (80/20 Rule)

**Norwegian Method:**
- 80% of training at low intensity (Zone 1-2, conversational pace)
- 20% at high intensity (Zone 4-5, threshold to VO2max)
- Minimize Zone 3 (moderate intensity)

**Heart Rate Zones:**
- Zone 1: 50-60% max HR (recovery)
- Zone 2: 60-70% max HR (aerobic base)
- Zone 3: 70-80% max HR (tempo/moderate)
- Zone 4: 80-90% max HR (threshold)
- Zone 5: 90-100% max HR (VO2max)

**Reference:** Seiler, S. & Tønnessen, E. (2009). "Intervals, Thresholds, and Long Slow Distance: the Role of Intensity and Duration in Endurance Training." *Sportscience* 13:32-53.

### Marathon Training

**16-20 Week Build:**
- Week 1-4: Base building (increase mileage 10% per week)
- Week 5-12: Specific training (long runs + tempo + intervals)
- Week 13-16: Peak phase
- Week 17-18: Taper (reduce volume 40-60%)
- Week 19-20: Race week

**Long Run Guidelines:**
- Progressive: Start at 30% of weekly mileage, build to 40%
- Max single run: 20-22 miles (physiological adaptation plateaus)
- Recovery: Easy pace, 1-2 days after long run

## Deload Protocols

**When to Deload:**
- Every 4-6 weeks (planned)
- HRV drops >10% below baseline
- Resting HR elevated +5 bpm for 3+ days
- Sleep quality degraded
- Persistent soreness/fatigue
- Performance plateau or regression

**How to Deload:**
- Reduce volume 40-60%
- Maintain or increase intensity (same weights, fewer sets)
- Reduce frequency by 1-2 sessions
- Duration: 5-7 days

**Reference:** Pritchard et al. (2015). "Effects of Deload on Muscle Hypertrophy." *J Strength Cond Res* 29(12):3388-95.

## Age Considerations

### Youth (<18 years)

**Restrictions:**
- No aggressive calorie deficits (<10% below TDEE)
- Avoid maximal lifts (>90% 1RM)
- Focus on technique and movement quality
- Growth plate awareness (no excessive axial loading)
- Volume caps (MEV to MAV, not MRV)

**Reference:** Lloyd et al. (2014). "Position Statement on Youth Resistance Training." *Br J Sports Med* 48:498-505.

### Older Adults (≥65 years)

**Modifications:**
- Include balance training (fall prevention)
- Start conservatively (50% of younger adult volume)
- Progress slowly (5% increases vs 10%)
- Emphasize functional movements
- Higher protein needs (+0.2 g/kg)
- Screen for osteoporosis (bone density)

**Reference:** Fragala et al. (2019). "Resistance Training for Older Adults." *J Strength Cond Res* 33(8):2019-2052.

## Special Populations

### Pregnancy

**Clearance Required:** OB/GYN approval

**Modifications:**
- Avoid supine exercises after 1st trimester (vena cava compression)
- Monitor for warning signs (bleeding, dizziness, contractions)
- Heart rate cap: 140 bpm (traditional guideline)
- Avoid contact sports and high fall-risk activities
- Pelvic floor training

**Reference:** ACOG Committee Opinion No. 804 (2020). "Physical Activity and Exercise During Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period." *Obstet Gynecol* 135:e178-88.

### Type 1 Diabetes

**Requirements:**
- Medical supervision
- Blood glucose monitoring pre/post exercise
- Insulin adjustment protocols
- Carb timing around training
- Hypo/hyperglycemia awareness

**Reference:** Riddell et al. (2017). "Exercise management in type 1 diabetes." *Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol* 5:377-390.

## Safety Boundaries

### Calorie Deficits

**Maximum Safe Deficits:**
- 25% below TDEE (750-1000 kcal/day deficit)
- Never below 1200 kcal (women) or 1500 kcal (men)
- Rate of loss: Max 1% bodyweight per week

**Exception:** Class 3 obesity (BMI >40) with medical supervision

**Reference:** Heymsfield et al. (2007). "Body size and human energy requirements: reduced mass-specific resting energy expenditure in tall adults." *J Appl Physiol* 103:1543-50.

### Volume Caps

**Weekly Volume Limits (per muscle):**
- Beginner: MEV to MEV+50%
- Intermediate: MEV to MAV
- Advanced: MAV to MRV (with caution)

**Volume Increases:**
- Max 10% per week (strength training)
- Max 10% per week (endurance running mileage)
- Max 20% per week in exceptional cases

## Summary: Decision Rules

1. **Protein**: Always prioritize protein minimum for goal
2. **Fat**: Never drop below 0.6 g/kg (hormonal floor)
3. **Calories**: Stay within -25% to +20% of TDEE
4. **Volume**: Progress 5-10% per week, deload every 4-6 weeks
5. **Safety**: Medical clearance for high-risk populations
6. **Age**: Reduce intensity/volume for youth and older adults

**When in doubt, choose the more conservative option.**
